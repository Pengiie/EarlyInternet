This small game was made within 3 days in Java utilizing my Sylk engine that can also be found here [here](https://github.com/Penguinz22/Sylk)

<p>The idea of the game is that you are a virus and you are almost simulating infecting a network of computers. The main goal of the game is to achieve a stable high percentage of infected computers which no clear win. Start off by slowly infecting computers on your own until the virus starts rapidly spreading on its own, though be careful of the antivirus present of computers actively trying to stop you. Purchase upgrades on the right side menu to keep your virus alive and thriving.</p>

Controls
<ul>
<li>Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move your bug around</li>
<li>Use [ and ] to zoom in and out of the map</li>
<li>Use - and + to decrease or increase the tick speed of the game</li>
</ul>

You can find the executable game jar in the releases tab which required Java 11 to run (Will convert my Sylk engine to Java 8 in the future).
